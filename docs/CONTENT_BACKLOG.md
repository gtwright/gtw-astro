# Content Backlog

Raw ideas, observations, and topics that might become posts or series. No commitment to sequence or format. Ideas get promoted to a series outline in `docs/series/` when they're ready.

---

## Series Candidates

### AWS AI Practitioner
Preparing for the AWS AI Practitioner certification. Posts built around self-designed exercises that cement the curriculum — not just study notes, but applied practice that produces shareable artifacts.

### Data Pipeline at the BSO
Real-world data engineering in a nonprofit/cultural org: ELT, data warehouse architecture, data activation, and the insights layer. What it takes to build a modern data pipeline when you're not a tech company.

### Performance History & Data Visualization
Expanding on previous work visualizing orchestral performance history data. The Beethoven/BSO chart is a starting point — there's a larger story about what decades of programming data reveal.

## Loose Ideas

- Schema.org best practices — auditing and expanding structured data
- Per-post OG images — generated at build time
- Comments/responses — webmentions, guestbook, or intentionally choosing none
- Redirects and URL management on Cloudflare
- AI-assisted development workflows — how Claude Code, Cursor, etc. change the way you build
- Accessibility as ongoing practice, not a checklist
- Analytics without surveillance — privacy-respecting measurement
