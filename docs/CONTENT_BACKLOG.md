# Content Backlog

Raw ideas, observations, and topics that might become posts or series. No commitment to sequence or format. Ideas get promoted to a series outline in `docs/series/` when they're ready.

---

## Series Candidates

### AWS AI Practitioner
Preparing for the AWS AI Practitioner certification. Posts built around self-designed exercises that cement the curriculum — not just study notes, but applied practice that produces shareable artifacts.

### Data Pipeline at the BSO
Real-world data engineering in a nonprofit/cultural org: ELT, data warehouse architecture, data activation, and the insights layer. What it takes to build a modern data pipeline when you're not a tech company.
####Reference pipeline using all open-source or free tools, for the benefit of smaller orgs

### Performance History & Data Visualization
Expanding on previous work visualizing orchestral performance history data. The Beethoven/BSO chart is a starting point — there's a larger story about what decades of programming data reveal.

### HENRY 2.0
Updating archives.bso.org. Modernizing the site, re-platforming the source data, building a pipeline (DBT/Dagster), and final search index (Typesense)
