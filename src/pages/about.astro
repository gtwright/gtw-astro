        I work in nonprofit and cultural orgs, helping teams use technology, creative,
        and communications systems in ways that support growth, deepen relationships with audiences,
        and strengthen mission impact. I'm interested in what actually helps institutions grow
        and serve people better.

        I'm currently the Director of Content and Digital Services at the Boston Symphony Orchestra,
        an organization which also includes the Boston Pops, Tanglewood Music Festival, and Symphony Hall.
        I often describe my team as the BSO's internal creative and digital agency.
        Marketing is our largest focus, but we support every part of the institution—from artistic
        and education to fundraising and operations. Our work spans digital platforms and data, storytelling
        and brand identity, and operational systems and processes.
