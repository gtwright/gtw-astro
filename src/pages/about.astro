      <h1>About Graham Wright</h1>
      <p>
        I work in nonprofit and cultural organizations, helping teams use technology, creative, communications systems, and experiences in ways that support growth, deepen relationships with audiences, and strengthen mission impact. I’m interested in what actually helps institutions grow and serve people better—not in theory, but within the constraints and tradeoffs of real-world conditions.
