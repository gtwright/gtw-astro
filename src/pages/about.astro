      <h1>Graham Wright</h1>
      <p>
        I work in nonprofit and cultural organizations, helping teams use technology, creative, and communications systems in ways that support growth, deepen relationships with audiences, and strengthen mission impact. I'm interested in what actually helps institutions grow and serve people better—grounded in real-world operating conditions and centered on the audience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently the Director of Content and Digital Services at the <a href="https://www.bso.org">Boston Symphony Orchestra</a>, an organization which also includes the Boston Pops, Tanglewood Music Festival, and Symphony Hall. I often describe my team as the BSO's internal creative and digital agency. Marketing is our largest focus, but we support every part of the institution—from artistic and education to fundraising and operations.
      </p>
      <h2>How I got here</h2>
      <p>
        My path into this work hasn't been linear. I came to Boston to pursue a PhD in chemistry at MIT and, along the way, discovered a vibrant music community that also became my home. As I spent more time in both worlds, I began looking for ways to work with science outside the lab—out of curiosity to spend more time discussing ideas and less time working at the bench.
      </p>
      <p>
        That search led me to an early career as a scientific conference producer, which unfolded in parallel with my work as a freelance musician. I was hired to be the expert on topics and speakers, but producing conferences quickly taught me that engaging a community around an idea requires much more than expertise. It requires marketing and sales, communications, operations, and the systems that support them. That was where I first began to understand how people, processes, and technology come together to help ideas find an audience and communities take shape.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time I stepped away from conference production to focus more fully on music, but my interest in communities and audience building continued. That curiosity eventually led me to found <a href="https://opusaffair.org">Opus Affair</a>, which began as a monthly convening of people interested in the arts—artists, administrators, and audiences—focused less on the performances themselves than on the social and cultural experience around them. The idea that sparked it was simple: more people cared about the arts than the public conversation often suggested, but they weren't always visible to one another. By committing to regular gatherings in venues—often cocktail bars—where that audience was already likely to be, we began to build a foundation for a community. And the community took shape quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        As it expanded, we began partnering with arts organizations to host events and produce experiences together, and eventually formed a boutique agency focused on digital and creative work that supported audience growth for cultural organizations around the country. Along the way I also worked inside organizations in different ways, including producing public programs and stepping into interim executive roles—experiences that deepened my understanding of how to advance strategy with limited resources and time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking back, the question that runs through most of my work is how people connect—with ideas, with each other, and with the institutions around them. Much of what I do now involves designing or improving the tools and systems that make those connections possible—whether that's a data pipeline that helps a fundraising team understand donor behavior, or a brand system that helps audiences recognize what an organization stands for. I'm especially interested in work that is practical, sustainable, and grounded in real conditions—thinking broadly about long-term direction while making incremental changes that can be measured, communicated, and adjusted over time.
