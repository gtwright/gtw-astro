      <h1>About</h1>

      <p>
        I'm a non-profit executive with a deep interest in how technology shapes our creative
        lives. By day, I lead an organization dedicated to expanding access and opportunity.
        By night — and on weekends, and during long walks — I think about the tools we build,
        the stories we tell, and the systems that connect them.
      </p>

      <p>
        This blog is a space for those explorations. You'll find writing about technology and
        its implications, creativity and craft, leadership in mission-driven organizations,
        and the occasional book review or field note from life at the intersection of purpose
        and innovation.
      </p>

        The name <em>The Examined Life</em> is borrowed, of course, from Socrates — a reminder
        that reflection is not a luxury but a practice. I hope something here resonates with you.
