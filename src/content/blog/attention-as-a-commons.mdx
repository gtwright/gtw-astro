title: "Attention as a Commons"
description: "What if we treated attention the way we treat shared natural resources — as something that can be depleted, polluted, and protected?"

Garrett Hardin's "tragedy of the commons" describes what happens when individuals deplete a shared resource by acting in their own short-term interest. Overfishing. Overgrazing. The slow death of a public good through a thousand rational private decisions.

I think the same thing is happening to human attention.

## The attention economy, revisited

We've been talking about the "attention economy" for two decades now, but the framing is wrong. An economy implies exchange — I give you attention, you give me value. What's actually happening is extraction. Attention is being mined, not traded.

Every notification, every autoplay video, every infinite scroll is a small withdrawal from a finite account. The individual withdrawals are trivial. The cumulative effect is not.

## What depletion looks like

I notice it in myself: the difficulty of reading a long article without checking my phone. The restlessness during any pause. The sense that silence is a problem to be solved rather than a condition to be savored.

I notice it in our organization's work too. The people we serve have less capacity for sustained engagement than they did five years ago. Attention poverty is real, and it compounds.

## Toward attention stewardship

If attention is a commons, then we — as technologists, as communicators, as leaders — have a stewardship responsibility. Every design decision is an ethical decision about how we treat other people's cognitive resources.

I don't have a policy proposal. But I have a principle: *build things that leave people with more attention than they started with, not less.*
