Six months ago, I signed up for a beginner ceramics class at the community art center. I went in looking for a hobby. What I found was a surprisingly precise metaphor for software development.

## The centering problem

The first thing you learn on the wheel is centering: getting the clay perfectly balanced before you start shaping. If the clay is off-center, everything you build on top of it will wobble. You can compensate, but the wobble never fully goes away.

Software has centering problems too. A misaligned data model. An architecture chosen for the wrong reasons. A team structure that doesn't match the system you're building. You can ship features on top of a wobble, but the wobble accumulates.

## The bisque fire

In ceramics, there are two firings. The first — the bisque fire — hardens the clay but leaves it porous. The piece is solid enough to handle but not yet finished. You can still apply glaze, make adjustments, add color. After the second firing, the piece is permanent. Beautiful or flawed, it's done.

Software rarely gets a second firing. We ship the bisque and call it done. The best teams I've worked with understand the value of that intermediate state — solid enough to use, porous enough to change.

## Embracing the crack

Every ceramicist loses pieces. The kiln is unpredictable. Clay has memory — stresses introduced during shaping can resurface during firing as cracks. You can do everything right and still lose the piece.

This is hard to accept if you come from a culture that equates failure with error. The ceramicist's relationship with failure is different: it's not a bug, it's a material property. The clay will do what the clay does. Your job is to work with it, not to defeat it.
