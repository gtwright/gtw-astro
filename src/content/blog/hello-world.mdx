There's a particular kind of joy in starting something new. A blank page, an empty editor, a fresh repository — each carries the same quiet promise: *this time, we'll get it right.*

I've been thinking a lot about tools lately. Not in the productivity-hacker sense of optimizing workflows or shaving seconds off builds, but in the deeper sense: the relationship between the instruments we choose and the work we produce.

## The medium is the message (still)

Marshall McLuhan's famous observation has aged remarkably well. The tools we use to create don't just facilitate our work — they shape it. A blog built with care and intention reads differently than one thrown together as an afterthought. The reader may not be able to articulate why, but they feel it.

> "We shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us." — John Culkin, summarizing McLuhan

This is why I care about typography, about white space, about the reading experience. Not out of vanity, but because **clarity is a form of respect** for the reader's time and attention.

## What good tools share

The best tools I've encountered — whether for writing, building, or leading — share a few qualities:

1. **They get out of the way.** The tool disappears when you're in flow.
2. **They have opinions.** Good defaults matter more than infinite configurability.
3. **They reward mastery.** There's always another level of depth to discover.
4. **They respect craft.** The tool itself was built with care.

### A note on simplicity

Simplicity is not the absence of complexity. It's complexity that has been thought through, organized, and presented with intention. The best writing is simple. The best software is simple. Neither is easy to produce.

## Code as craft

For those of us who write code, there's a creative dimension that's often overlooked. Consider a function:

```javascript
function readingTime(text) {
  const wordsPerMinute = 200;
  const words = text.split(/\s+/).length;
  return Math.ceil(words / wordsPerMinute);
}
```

This is not just engineering. It's a small act of design — naming things, choosing structures, making decisions about what matters and what doesn't.

Even inline references like `const WPM = 200` carry intent. Every variable name is a tiny editorial decision.

## Looking ahead

This blog is an experiment in practicing what I preach. It's built with tools I believe in:

- **Astro** for its content-first philosophy
- **Tailwind** for utility-driven design
- **MDX** for the flexibility to mix prose and components
- **Cloudflare Workers** for fast, global delivery

None of these choices are accidental. Each reflects a value: performance, clarity, flexibility, reach.

I don't know yet what shape this space will take. That's part of the appeal. The examined life, as Socrates suggested, is the only one worth living. The examined creative practice — the one where we ask *why* before *how* — might be the only one worth sharing.

Thanks for reading. More soon.
