Nietzsche said that only thoughts conceived while walking have any value. That's an overstatement, but not by much.

My best ideas — the ones that actually survive contact with reality — almost never arrive while I'm sitting at a computer. They come on walks. Long ones, preferably without a destination, ideally in weather that's slightly uncomfortable.

## The problem with desks

A desk is optimized for execution, not invention. The posture is wrong. The screen pulls your attention into the specific and immediate. The notifications are relentless. You can *refine* an idea at a desk. You can *implement* one. But generating something genuinely new seems to require a different mode entirely.

## What walking does

Walking occupies just enough of your body to free your mind. The rhythm is important — it's a kind of clock that your thoughts synchronize to. The changing scenery provides a steady stream of low-stakes novelty that keeps the default mode network active without overwhelming it.

## A practice, not a hack

I want to be careful not to turn this into a productivity tip. Walking is not a "hack" for better thinking. It's a practice — one that requires time, regularity, and the willingness to not produce anything at all on most walks.

The walk where nothing comes is not a failed walk. It's the necessary ground for the walk where everything comes.
