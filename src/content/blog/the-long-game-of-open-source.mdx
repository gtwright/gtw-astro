The Log4Shell vulnerability in December 2021 briefly made the world aware of something open source maintainers already knew: critical internet infrastructure is maintained by a surprisingly small number of people, often unpaid, often burned out.

The world noticed. Then it forgot. I'd like to not forget.

## The subsidy we don't see

Open source software is a massive public subsidy to the private sector. Companies worth billions run on code maintained by volunteers. The economic value generated is incalculable. The investment flowing back to maintainers is, in most cases, negligible.

This is not a market failure in the traditional sense. It's a commons problem — the same kind of structural underinvestment we see in bridges, water systems, and public education.

## What non-profits can do

Non-profits are uniquely positioned to contribute to open source sustainability. We understand public goods. We understand the gap between value created and value captured. And many of us are heavy users of open source tools.

At our organization, we've started budgeting for open source contributions the way we budget for utilities. It's not charity — it's infrastructure maintenance. We use these tools every day. Paying for them is a cost of doing business.

## The institutional case

I'd like to see more foundations and non-profit funders treat open source sustainability as a grantmaking category. Not because it's trendy, but because it's load-bearing. The programs they fund depend on software that depends on maintainers who depend on… what, exactly?

That dependency chain deserves the same scrutiny we give any other critical infrastructure.
