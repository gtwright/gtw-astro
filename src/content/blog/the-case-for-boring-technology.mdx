Dan McKinley's 2015 essay "Choose Boring Technology" has become a touchstone for a reason. The core argument is simple: every organization has a limited number of innovation tokens. Spend them on the things that matter most — your core mission — not on your database or your deployment pipeline.

I think about this constantly.

## Innovation tokens at a non-profit

Non-profits operate with tighter constraints than most startups. Smaller teams, smaller budgets, higher stakes for failure. When a for-profit startup picks the wrong database, they lose money. When a non-profit's donor management system fails during a capital campaign, real programs serving real people are at risk.

This changes the calculus. Boring isn't just acceptable — it's a fiduciary responsibility.

## What boring looks like

At our organization, boring technology means:

- **PostgreSQL** instead of the newest distributed database
- **Email** instead of the newest team communication platform
- **Server-rendered HTML** instead of a single-page application
- **Spreadsheets** for things that don't yet need a custom tool

None of this is exciting. All of it works. Our team spends their time on mission delivery, not on wrestling with infrastructure.

## When to spend the token

The corollary to "choose boring" is: *when you do innovate, make it count*. We spent an innovation token on a custom data pipeline for our impact reporting. It was worth it — that's our differentiator, the thing that lets us tell our story with evidence. Everything else is PostgreSQL and email.
