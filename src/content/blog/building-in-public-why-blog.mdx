Topics to cover:
- Blogging as a thinking tool, not a publishing channel
- Writing for durability, not velocity
- Why a custom build instead of Substack / Medium / Ghost
- The motivation: a content-first personal site for writing about technology, creativity, and nonprofit leadership

I'm certainly no stranger to having a presence on the internet, but my personal website has largely been a simple landing page to point to my presence elsewhere. 
There are a few reasons I've been thinking the time has some to build a new site and commit to a regular publishing habit:

- There is less time for building in my day job and I do like to keep my skills sharp.
- Since I don't have as many client projects or hobby projects as I used to, there are fewer opportunities
to test new tools and approaches. I want to keep myself commited to building in public and learning new things.
- When I'm interacting with colleagues at conferences and elsewhere, I'm eager to share what I'm working on what I've learned, but there's not much that's
documented and easily accessible.
- Throughout all of the above, I'm interested in keeping a record of experiements and leraning, so I can have breadcrumbs for myself. If they help others. Even better.
- The motivation for learnign and documenting in public is largely about my professional interests in applying technology within non-profits, but I won't limit mseyfl to thoes areas.

More to come on the specific tech stack I'm chosing for this site and the process of building it.
