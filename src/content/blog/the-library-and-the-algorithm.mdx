There is a building in nearly every American town that offers free access to knowledge, internet, meeting space, and human expertise — no subscription required. We call it a library.

I've been thinking about what it means that our most enduring public technology is a room full of books staffed by people who want to help you find things. There's a lesson there for anyone building digital platforms.

## Access as architecture

The Carnegie library model was radical in its simplicity: build a beautiful building, fill it with books, and open the doors to everyone. No means testing. No tiered access. The architecture itself was the argument — that knowledge belongs to the public.

Modern tech platforms make the opposite architectural argument. The building is free to enter, but the rooms get progressively locked. The best content is behind the paywall. The algorithm decides what you see.

## What librarians know

Librarians are the original search engine, and they understand something Google still struggles with: the difference between what someone *asks for* and what they *need*. A reference interview — the quiet back-and-forth at the desk — is a kind of empathy technology hasn't replicated.

## The durability question

Libraries have survived every predicted extinction: radio, television, the internet, e-books, ChatGPT. Each time, they adapted. Not by becoming something else, but by being more fully themselves.

That's a model worth studying.
