When I took my current role, the job description said nothing about APIs, data pipelines, or cloud infrastructure. Five years in, I spend a meaningful portion of my time on exactly those things.

This isn't a complaint. It's an observation about how the nature of institutional leadership has changed — and how slowly our mental models have caught up.

## The accidental technologist

Most non-profit leaders I know didn't set out to become technology decision-makers. They were drawn to mission: education, health, environment, arts, justice. But mission delivery is now inseparable from technology choices.

The CRM you pick shapes how you understand your constituents. The communication platform you choose determines whose voices get heard. The data you collect — and don't collect — defines what you can measure and what remains invisible.

## Staying grounded

The temptation is to chase every new tool. The discipline is to ask: *does this serve the mission, or does it serve the appearance of innovation?*

I've found that the best technology decisions in non-profit work share a quality with the best program design: they center the people you serve, not the people who build.

## What I'm still learning

I don't have this figured out. But I've come to believe that technical literacy — not expertise, but literacy — is now a core leadership competency. Not so you can build the thing yourself, but so you can ask the right questions of those who do.
