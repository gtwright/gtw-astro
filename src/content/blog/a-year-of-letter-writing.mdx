On January 1st of last year, I made a quiet resolution: write one handwritten letter per week for a year. Not emails. Not texts. Letters — on paper, with a pen, in an envelope with a stamp.

Fifty-two letters later, I have some thoughts.

## The slowness is the point

A letter can't be dashed off. The medium resists speed. You have to think before you write, because crossing out looks terrible and starting over means wasting a sheet of good stationery. This constraint — which felt limiting at first — turned out to be liberating.

When you can't edit, you have to mean what you say the first time. That changes what you say.

## Who I wrote to

I wrote to friends, family, colleagues, mentors, and a few people I'd never met but whose work I admired. The letters to strangers were the hardest and, often, the most rewarding. Three of them wrote back. One of those exchanges became an ongoing correspondence that I now treasure.

## What I noticed

Handwriting activates a different part of the brain than typing. I don't have the neuroscience to explain it precisely, but the experience is unmistakable. My letters said things my emails never would — not because they were more honest, but because they were more considered. The slow medium produced slower, deeper thinking.

## Will I continue?

Yes, though probably not weekly. The practice taught me something about the relationship between medium and message that I won't unlearn. And there's something irreducibly human about receiving a physical letter — the handwriting, the stamp, the knowledge that someone spent twenty minutes thinking about you specifically.

In an age of infinite digital communication, that scarcity is a gift.
