I almost didn't go. The flights were expensive, the agenda looked predictable, and I had a full week of work waiting for me. I went anyway, mostly out of obligation.

It turned out to be the most valuable professional experience of my year. Not because of the sessions — though a few were good — but because of the hallways.

## The hallway track

Conference veterans know that the real conference happens between sessions. The coffee line. The awkward lunch table where you sit down next to a stranger. The late-night conversation in the hotel lobby where someone says the thing they'd never say on a panel.

This is where I learned that three other organizations were wrestling with the same data integration problem we'd been stuck on for months. One of them had solved it. That single conversation saved us six months of work.

## Why "virtual" isn't the same

I'm not a Luddite about virtual events. They have real advantages: accessibility, cost, convenience. But they don't produce hallway conversations. A Zoom call with someone you already know is a meeting. A surprise conversation with a stranger is something else entirely — it's serendipity, and serendipity requires physical co-presence in ways we don't fully understand.

## The obligation to show up

I've started thinking of conference attendance less as professional development and more as institutional citizenship. You go not just to learn, but to be available for the conversation someone else needs to have. Sometimes you're the person with the answer. Sometimes you're the person who asks the question that unlocks someone else's thinking.

Showing up is a form of generosity. I need to remember that next time I'm looking at flight prices.
