I keep two reading lists. The first is the one I share with people: the books that shaped my thinking, the essays I recommend, the authors I admire. The second list is private: the books that made me deeply uncomfortable.

The second list has been more important to my growth.

## The comfort trap

It's natural to read things that confirm what we already believe. Algorithms are designed to feed us more of the same. But a reading practice built entirely on agreement is a kind of intellectual stagnation disguised as learning.

The books that changed my mind — really changed it, not just added nuance — were books I initially resisted. I picked them up skeptically. I argued with the margins. And then, sometimes gradually and sometimes all at once, I realized the author had a point I hadn't considered.

## How I choose

I try to follow a rough rule: for every three books in my comfort zone, I read one that isn't. Sometimes that means a political perspective I disagree with. Sometimes it means a discipline I know nothing about — evolutionary biology, urban planning, liturgical theology. The point isn't to become a generalist. It's to stay porous.

## The notebook practice

I keep a small notebook for passages that surprise me. Not passages I agree with — passages that stop me. The ones where I have to put the book down and stare at the wall for a minute. Those are the ones worth returning to.

Over time, that notebook has become a map of my own blind spots. It's uncomfortable and invaluable.
