There's a beautiful essay by Lee Vinsel and Andrew Russell called "Hail the Maintainers" that argues we've built an entire culture around innovation while ignoring the far more common and arguably more important work of maintenance.

I think about this in the context of my own organization every week.

## The glamour problem

In non-profit work, as in tech, new things get attention. A new program launch gets a press release. A new partnership gets a board presentation. A new building gets a ribbon cutting.

But the program that's been running effectively for twelve years? The database migration that prevented a catastrophic data loss? The staff member who quietly keeps the finances accurate month after month? These don't get ribbons.

## Maintenance is skilled work

There's a misconception that maintenance is less intellectually demanding than creation. Anyone who has maintained a legacy codebase, kept a twenty-year-old program relevant, or managed an aging building knows this is wrong.

Maintenance requires deep knowledge of how things actually work — not how they were designed to work, but how they work now, with all their accumulated patches and workarounds. It requires the humility to serve a system rather than impose your vision on it.

## A maintenance-first culture

I'm trying to build a culture in our organization where maintenance is celebrated. Where the person who fixes the broken process gets the same recognition as the person who launched the new initiative. Where "keeping the lights on" is understood as a creative act.

We're not there yet. But naming the problem is the first step.
