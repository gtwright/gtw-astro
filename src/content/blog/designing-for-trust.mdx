A colleague recently asked me what I thought our organization's most important asset was. I didn't say our programs, our team, or our data. I said trust.

Everything else depends on it. Donors trust us with their money. Communities trust us with their stories. Partners trust us with their reputations. Staff trust us with their careers. Without trust, we're just a legal entity with a nice mission statement.

## Trust as a design problem

I've started thinking about trust not as a feeling but as a design outcome. You can design systems that build trust, and you can design systems that erode it. The difference often comes down to transparency, consistency, and the willingness to be accountable when things go wrong.

## The small signals

Trust is built in small moments more than big ones. Responding to an email promptly. Publishing your financials without being asked. Admitting a mistake before someone discovers it. These aren't strategic moves — they're habits. And habits are designed, even when we don't realize it.

## Where technology helps (and hurts)

Technology can be a trust accelerator or a trust destroyer. A well-designed donor portal that shows exactly how funds were used builds trust. A poorly secured database that leaks personal information destroys it. A transparent algorithm that explains its recommendations builds trust. An opaque one that produces inexplicable results destroys it.

The technical decisions we make are trust decisions, whether we frame them that way or not.
