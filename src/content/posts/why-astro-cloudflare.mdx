{/* Post 0.2 in the Building in Public series — consolidates the original 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4. */}

{/*
## Principles and constraints
- Static-first mindset
- Low maintenance, high clarity
- Content > chrome
- Explicit over clever
- Learning in public without performative complexity
- Accessibility as a foundational constraint, not a post-launch checklist — WCAG 2.2 AA floor, AAA target

## Choosing Astro v6 (beta)
- Why Astro — static-first with an escape hatch, content collections, islands mental model
- Why Astro over Next.js, Hugo, 11ty, etc.
- Why v6 now — living on the edge intentionally, trade-offs in a learning project
- What risks are acceptable and what to expect as v6 stabilizes

## Deployment philosophy
- Cloudflare as the target platform
- Why Astro v6 defaults to Workers
- Cloudflare's convergence on Workers as a full-stack runtime
- Light comparison: Pages vs Workers
- Decision: start with Workers for optionality, even if overkill today
